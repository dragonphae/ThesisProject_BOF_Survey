<h2><b><u>Purpose of this study:</u></b></h2>
<br>
Presently, online platforms for socialization are an everyday part of people’s lives, and their use has been growing, becoming more (not less) embedded in how people interact with each other. This study investigates existing online platforms that have a high level of creative and social behaviour in order to discover more about which social features and technical affordances lead to social connection and creativity through online interaction— both of which are linked to increased well-being. From our interview and survey data, we expect that design recommendations can be synthesized, which will support developers of future platforms to encourage more making and sharing behaviour that benefits the users and their wellbeing. 
<br><br>
You have been invited to participate in this study because you regularly engage in creating and connecting on a platform for collaborative creativity. We think such regular engagement will help us learn from you about your experiences on these platforms, the social value you have gained from these platforms, and the mechanisms or processes you use to create and connect with others.
<br><br>

<h2><b><u>If I choose to take part in this study, what will I do?</u></b></h2>
<br>
If you take part in this study, you will:<br> 
<ul>
<li>Fill in a questionnaire that includes demographic questions and some questions about your experience on the collaborative creativity platform. This questionnaire will take at most 15-minutes of your time.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2><b><u>Data Gathering</u></b></h2>
<br>

In this study, data will be gathered using an online questionnaire. This will include questions about basic demographics, as well as your experiences with creating and sharing on online platforms. The survey will be administered through a link to a custom webpage and data will be stored on a server provided by the Digital Research Alliance of Canada. 
<br><br>
The gathered data will be used for analysis (i.e., using the data we will explore how and why people use online platforms for making and connecting, as well as what social value they derive from it). The questionnaire responses will be shared in research articles, student thesis, and research presentations. However, such sharing will be done anonymously and in an aggregate form. In other words, we will not associate the data with any of your personal identifiers.
<br><br>

<b>You do not have to answer any questions or complete any tests that make you feel uncomfortable.</b>
<br><br>
<h2><b><u>How long will this take?</u></b></h2>
<br>
The questionnaire will take about 15 minutes of your time and will take place online
<br><br>
<h2><b><u>What are the possible harms and discomforts?</u></b></h2>
<br>
There are no known risks associated with taking part in this study.
<br><br>
<h2><b><u>What are the possible benefits of taking part in this study?</u></b></h2>
<br>
You may benefit from this study through becoming more reflective about how you use collaborative online platforms to make and connect with others, and may perhaps be inspired to create and connect online with others in new ways. This is beneficial as both being creative and connecting socially with other people have been shown to improve well-being.
<br><br>
As well, you will be contributing to the state of knowledge on how to design online platforms to encourage both creativity (making) and sharing (social connection). In the modern day, online platforms are frequently used for various purposes and the study of how to design them to encourage well-being would be beneficial to many people. Our study has the potential to contribute novel insights into which social factors and technical affordances in digital platforms are potentially useful for fostering creating and connecting. 
<br><br>
<h2><b><u>Will I receive any compensation for taking part in the study?</u></b></h2>
<br>
You will receive either an Amazon e-gift card (CAD 5$) or a $5 Prolific payment as a small thank-you gift. 
If you start the survey and then decide you want to withdraw, you will still receive the gift card. 
<br><br>
<h2><b><u>Who will see my information?</u></b></h2>
<br>
The data that we gather will be confidential.  As well, for analysis and reporting of the results all data will be confidential. Each participant will be assigned a unique ID and all of their data will be associated with this unique ID. This unique ID will not contain any identifiable information. 
<br><br>
Please be advised that information about you that is gathered for this research study uses a third-party online server provided by the Digital Research Alliance of Canada. As such, there is a possibility that information about you may be accessible by this group during the online research collection process. 
<br><br>
Data collected from participants will be downloaded and stored in an encrypted drive that is only accessible by the researchers on this ethics application. 
<br><br>
Information collected during this study will be stored for 5 years. At the end of this time, all paper records will be shredded, and all audiotapes/videotapes/computer files will be deleted.    
<br><br>

<h2><b><u>How will the study results be shared?</u></b></h2>
<br>
Findings from this study will be reported in journal or conference articles, or books and in the student’s thesis. The findings may be presented at workshops/conferences. Your name will not be used in these publications or presentations.
<br><br>
<h2><b><u>Please note:</u></b></h2>
<ul>
<li>You may change your mind and withdraw from this study at any time. There is no need to explain why you have changed your mind. If you withdraw from the study your contribution will not be used in the analysis or final report.</li>


 <li>You do not have to answer any questions or complete any tests that make you feel uncomfortable.</li>


 <li>It’s your choice whether or not you want to take part in this study. Your participation is voluntary.</li>
